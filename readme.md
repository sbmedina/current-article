The exercise of the sixth week consists of selecting a current news from an online newspaper of your choice and creating an HTML document that has the same content as the news (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.) respecting the elements HTML semantics and saving progress to a public Github repository.

Seventh week: We propose to look for a new news in English, but we must pay attention to the HTML content and also to the style. The problem this week is to create a new HTML document including the CSS style to make the page look identical to the original newspaper when viewing. This should be done for both the new news and the one we created in week 6.
It will also be necessary to add a link to the beginning or end of each news item to navigate within the newspaper that we are creating. That is, from the news of week 6 to the news of week 7 and vice versa.
