                Many people dream of making a sea change and leaving the stresses of the city behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the pandemic, it was a fantasy reserved for the lucky few but working remotely allowed many Australians to escape the hustle and bustle, or at least seriously consider the possibility of a move in the future.

                According to research published last week, one in five city dwellers want to move to regional Australia in the next year. <a href="http://www.regionalaustralia.org.au/home/new-research-shows-why-city-dwellers-want-a-life-in-the-country-and-when-they-might-move/">Some 69 per cent said</a> reducing general stress and anxiety was the major driver behind that decision, which begs the question: do you need to move out of the city to slow down?
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t think so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the pandemic began and <a href="http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/8451-roy-morgan-working-from-home-june-2020-202006290638">at least a third</a> of Australian workers moved their offices online, many decided the time was ripe to try a sea or tree change, driving up house prices in popular small towns like Byron Bay <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/regional-house-prices-soar-40pc-as-covid-19-accelerates-boom-20210113-p56trb">by 40 per cent</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While everyone seemed to be “<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sydneysiders-voting-with-their-feet-and-opting-for-sea-or-tree-change-20210205-p57036.html">voting with their feet</a>” and escaping the city to go live the dream, after four years of <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/live-and-let-live-on-the-coast-of-utopia-aka-byron-bay-20190709-p525ms.html">living in Byron,</a> my young family and I decided to move back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back in the city nearly nine months now, I’ve learned that the dream can be great, but so can the ‘reality’ and, IMHO, we can learn to live slower and more connected lives in the big smoke too.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The reality of living the dream
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are major drawcards to living in a small town like Byron: the community - imagine people actually smiling and saying “hello” as you walk down the street, the free live music, pop-up pizza nights in the park, and the boundless natural beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you want to move away from the stress that can come from <a href="https://theconversation.com/cities-increase-your-risk-of-depression-anxiety-and-psychosis-but-bring-mental-health-benefits-too-128911">living in the city</a>, bear in mind that regional areas come with their own challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                For starters, status symbols exist everywhere, albeit in different ways. In Byron, you might swap the BMW for the VW Transporter and the Labradoodle for the kelpie or cattle dog; the PE Nation and Country Road are swapped for linen and boho chic; and while there may be less suits with attitude, there are more surfers with attitude, especially now that all their pristine waves are crowded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although you might not be judged by how much money you make or whether you live in a house (#vanlife) you may well be judged by how much you’ve been swallowed-up by the "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210120-how-the-world-became-consumerist">gargantuan and growing appetite</a>" of consumerism, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/oxfam-name-the-biggest-fashion-brands-to-exploit-factory-workers-20191125-p53e0x.html">how fast your fashion</a> is and how many packaged foods are in your pantry.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are more serious issues as well. Rates of homelessness in the Byron Shire, for instance, are <a href="https://www.byron.nsw.gov.au/Council/Media-centre/Media-releases/Rough-sleeping-count-reveals-Byron-Shires-urgent-need-for-outreach-services">twice the national average,</a> mental health issues are just as rife and small towns that lack proper infrastructure can struggle when their population swells.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is particularly apparent during the holiday season says Dr Liz Allen, a demographer from ANU.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The sewage system and water systems cannot cope with the influx,” Allen explains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Small towns offer “quite a lot of potential” in terms of homeownership, wide open spaces and proximity to nature, Allen adds, but they can also be problematic when it comes to accessing healthcare, employment opportunities and education:
            </p>
            <p>
                “Our postcode determines a whole range of wellbeing outcomes - our life expectancy for instance. People beyond the city limits have fewer opportunities, less choice, less access to a whole range of health care and healthy behaviours.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Healthy foods are not a problem, in Byron at least, where they come with the same price tags as any fancy Sydney or Melbourne suburb, but access to adequate health care can be an issue. I experienced this directly while in labour with my first child. When it wasn’t going the way I hoped and the decision was made to transfer me from the midwives’ clinic to hospital, there were no ambulances available. Ultimately my partner had to drive me the 45 minutes to the nearest hospital. I was lucky my daughter and I were not in imminent danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving away from perceived stressors may be incredibly romantic, Allen says, “but the reality is that comes at a great cost in terms of the opportunities that are then granted and afforded to people that move to areas that don’t have the physical infrastructure that’s necessary.”

            <h3>
                Making the reality the dream
            </h3>
            <p>
                Dr Craig Hassed OAM is an associate professor in the Department of General Practice and the coordinator of mindfulness programs at Monash University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether or not you need to move away from the city to slow down depends, he says:
            </p>
            <p>
                “Being in a more natural environment makes it easier to connect. A slower pace of life makes it easier to slow down. Knowing more of the people around you at the local shop and having more space makes it easier. It can be more challenging in the hurly burley urban environment.”
            </p>
            <p>
                But, he adds that if we’re trying to escape from whatever is in our own heads, then we’ll simply relocate those struggles with us wherever we go.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So it’s got to be a mental thing, not just a physical thing,” Hassed says. “Just relocating somewhere else won’t slow the phantoms of our own imagination.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The way that we live can also make the difference, regardless of where we are.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If we fill our lives with clutter and technology and constant distraction and notifications and indoors and on the screen the whole time, then it’s not going to serve us well: How do we set up our own home, are we constantly distracted on our technology, do we have noise going on 24 hours a day, do we take time to get out into the natural parklands in an urban environment, do we take time to exercise?”

            <p>
                By addressing these factors that make life feel fast, we can create more mental space and slow down wherever we are.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are an abundance of people who never look back once they make the move to a small town and though I adored living out of the city, the pull to be near close friends and family became stronger once we had kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being back in the city and even going into the office, having the connection in real life to a team, is better than I imagined, but I try to take the slowness of small town life with me: I spend time in nature regularly, I try to focus on the people around me more, I remove distractions as much as possible and actively appreciate the place we live in. To me, city life can be as fast or slow, as fertile or fruitless as we make it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Andrea Mechelli, a professor in the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College in London, says:
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ultimately, cities offer a swath of obstacles and opportunities, freedom and captivity, which can challenge as well as nurture us, often at the same time".
            </p>
            <p>
                Hassed agrees that the city can be challenging but it can light us up and plug us into ourselves too, if we choose. It can even be compatible with a slower life too: “We can very much live in an urban environment in a mindful way with plenty of space.”
